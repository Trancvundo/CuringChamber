# CuringChamber

Mine version of a Curing Chamber for meat/cheese/mushroom.

Inspired by https://github.com/chennes/CuringChamberControl.

Arduino code for a DIY Curing Chamber (made from a old fridge) 

It controls the temperature and humidity. With a adjustable range and time limit for activation (safety).

This code use a single DHT22 sensor.

AC power to a refrigerator
AC power to a heating lamp
DC power to a humidifier
DC power to a fan

Also a small fan for constant airflow.

In my climate a medium fan is enough for decreasing humidity. 

You can make a hole in chamber with a filter for faster decreasing humidity or use a dehumidifier.

#Future Work
Adding LCD

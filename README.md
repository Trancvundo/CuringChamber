# CuringChamber

Mine version of a Curing Chamber for meat/cheese/mushroom.

Inspired by https://github.com/chennes/CuringChamberControl.

Small fan for constant airflow.

In my climate a larger fan is enough for decreasing humidity. 

You can make a hole in chamber with a filter for faster decreasing humidity or dehumidifier.
